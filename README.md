- The webiste is a one day website where it is only available for one day per week for employees. The employees are given weekly task to reduce their carbon footprint.
- The weekly theme is changed each week e.g transport, food etc.
- They can compare their carbon footprint against other employees in the company.
- If they want to find out more details, there is also a details on reducing carbon footprint based on the theme for that particular week.
- There is also a optional feedback section, so that the company can collect data on how the employees are reducing their carbon footprint.
